**ISIC Challenge 2018: International Skin Imaging Collaboration Challenge 2018** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical research. 

The dataset consists of 3694 images with 18055 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *skin cancer*, *pigment network*, *globule*, and other: *milia like cyst*, *negative network*, and *streaks*.

Images in the ISIC Challenge 2018 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (2594 images), *test* (1000 images), and *val* (100 images). The dataset was released in 2018 by the US-AT joint research group.
