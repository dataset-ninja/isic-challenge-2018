**ISIC Challenge 2018: International Skin Imaging Collaboration Challenge 2018** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical research. 

The dataset consists of 15414 images with 18055 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *skin cancer*, *pigment network*, *globule*, and other: *milia like cyst*, *negative network*, and *streaks*.

Images in the ISIC Challenge 2018 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 11720 (76% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (12609 images), *test* (2512 images), and *val* (293 images). Additionally, images with ***lesion segmentation*** are marked with ***task 1: lesion segmentation*** tag, images with ***attribute detection*** are marked with ***task 2: attribute detection*** tag and images with ***disease classification*** are marked with ***task 3: disease classification*** tag. Labels with ***lesion segmentation*** and ***attribute detection*** are marked by ***task*** tag with ***1*** or ***2*** values respectively. The dataset was released in 2018 by the US-AT joint research group.
