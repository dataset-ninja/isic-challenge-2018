**ISIC Challenge 2018: International Skin Imaging Collaboration Challenge 2018** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical research. 

The dataset consists of 15414 images with 18055 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *skin cancer*, *pigment network*, *globule*, and other: *milia like cyst*, *negative network*, and *streaks*.

Images in the ISIC Challenge 2018 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 11720 (76% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (12609 images), *test* (2512 images), and *val* (293 images). Additionally, labels with ***lesion segmentation*** are marked with ***task 1*** tag, labels with ***attribute detection*** are marked with ***task 2*** tag and images with ***disease classification*** are marked with ***task 3*** tag.***. The dataset was released in 2018 by the US-AT joint research group.
