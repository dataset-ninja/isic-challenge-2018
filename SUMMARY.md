**ISIC Challenge 2018: International Skin Imaging Collaboration Challenge 2018** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical research. 

The dataset consists of 15414 images with 18055 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *skin cancer*, *pigment network*, *globule*, and other: *milia like cyst*, *negative network*, and *streaks*.

Images in the ISIC Challenge 2018 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 11720 (76% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (12609 images), *test* (2512 images), and *val* (293 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 tasks: ***task 3: disease classification*** (11720 images), ***task 1: lesion segmentation*** (3694 images), and ***task 2: attribution detection*** (3694 images).  Labels with lesion segmentation and attribute detection tasks are marked with the ***task*** (1 or 2 respectively). The dataset was released in 2018 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">US-AT joint research group</span>.
