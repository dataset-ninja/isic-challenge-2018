## Motivation

The authors of the dataset emphasize that skin cancer, being the most prevalent form of cancer, poses challenges in early detection due to visual similarities with benign lesions. The challenge discussed in their workshop represents the latest iteration of the largest automated skin cancer recognition challenge within the community. Hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), the challenge aims to advance methods for segmentation, clinical attribute detection, and disease classification in dermoscopic images. In collaboration with the machine learning challenge, the authors planned to execute a significant reader study focused on disease diagnosis.

## ISIC Challenge 2018 Overview

The study, sponsored by the International Dermatoscopy Society (IDS), provided human diagnostic accuracy data for hundreds of images. Clinician participants numbering in the hundreds from around the world contributed to **ISIC Challenge 2018** dataset. This comprehensive dataset provided the basis for comparing the diagnostic performance of machine learning algorithms with clinical experts of different levels of expertise. The ISIC 2018 task included several independent subtasks:

1. Predict lesion segmentation masks from dermoscopic images.

2. Classify and localize clinical dermoscopic attribute patterns as binary masks. Categories include _network_, _negative network_, _pigment network_, _streaks_, _milia-like cysts_ and _globules_.
